## Internship Overview

During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam** from **12/08/2025** to **12/11/2025** as an **FCJ Cloud Intern**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment in the field of Cloud Computing.

I participated in **building the Serverless Student Management Platform on AWS**, including designing serverless architecture with 14 AWS services (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Cognito, S3, CloudWatch, EventBridge, SES, Amplify, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Route53, WAF), developing 17 REST API endpoints, implementing chat system with polling mechanism, and setting up CI/CD pipeline with GitLab and AWS CodePipeline.

Through this experience, I significantly improved the following skills:
- **Technical skills:** AWS serverless architecture, Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK), NoSQL database design (DynamoDB), GraphQL API development, real-time applications, event-driven architecture, CI/CD automation
- **Soft skills:** teamwork with parallel development (Backend/Frontend teams), Agile project management, technical documentation, problem-solving in production environments
- **Professional skills:** AWS Well-Architected Framework, security best practices, cost optimization, performance tuning, testing strategies

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks on time according to the timeline (5 weeks with 5 clear phases), adhered to coding standards and AWS security guidelines, and actively engaged with mentors and team members to improve work efficiency through daily standups and weekly sprint reviews.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Discipline
**Current Situation:** Sometimes still complacent in adhering to some minor processes such as commit message standards or branch naming conventions.

**Improvement Plan:**
- Set up Git hooks to enforce commit message format and branch naming
- Use checklist before each pull request to ensure full compliance with coding standards
- Learn from senior developers about discipline in software development

### 2. Problem-Solving Mindset
**Current Situation:** In some complex situations (such as Lambda cold start optimization or DynamoDB query performance), I still spent a lot of time finding the root cause due to lack of experience troubleshooting production issues.

**Improvement Plan:**
- Learn more about AWS troubleshooting techniques and best practices from AWS documentation
- Practice systematic debugging with CloudWatch Logs, X-Ray tracing
- Build personal knowledge base about common issues and solutions in serverless architecture
- Join AWS community forums to learn from real-world scenarios

### 3. Communication & Presentation Skills
**Current Situation:** When presenting complex technical concepts (such as DynamoDB GSI design patterns or event-driven architecture), I sometimes struggle to express them clearly and understandably for people without technical background.

**Improvement Plan:**
- Practice simplifying technical concepts using analogies and visual diagrams
- Practice presentation skills through creating technical blog posts or video tutorials
- Learn storytelling to make technical presentations more engaging
- Request feedback after each presentation for continuous improvement

### 4. Time Management Skills
**Current Situation:** In the early stages (Week 1-2), I underestimated the effort for some complex tasks like DynamoDB schema design with GSI, leading to extra hours to catch up.

**Improvement Plan:**
- Use time tracking tools (Toggl, Clockify) to analyze actual time for each type of task
- Apply buffer time (add 20-30% estimated time) for unfamiliar tasks
- Break down large tasks into smaller chunks for more accurate estimation
- Review and adjust estimates based on past performance data

## Personal Development Plan

- **Certification:** Prepare for and take AWS Solutions Architect Professional exam
- **Expertise:** Learn about microservices architecture, container orchestration (Kubernetes)
- **Leadership:** Mentor junior members in team or community projects
- **Networking:** Join AWS User Groups, tech meetups to expand network

### Long-term (1-2 years)
- **Role:** Develop towards Cloud Solutions Architect or DevOps Engineer
- **Specialization:** Become expert in a specific area (serverless architecture, cost optimization, security)
- **Contribution:** Write technical blogs, create video tutorials, or speak at conferences
- **Impact:** Build and lead larger projects with team size of 5-10 people

## Conclusion

The internship period at AWS has been an invaluable experience, helping me not only enhance professional knowledge in cloud computing but also develop soft skills necessary for a software engineer. I highly appreciate the professional working environment, dedicated support from mentors and team, as well as the opportunity to work with the most advanced technologies.

What I learned from the Serverless Student Management Platform project is not just technical, but also the professional approach in software development: from planning, design, implementation, testing, documentation, to deployment and monitoring. This is a solid foundation for me to continue developing my career in Cloud Computing and Software Engineering.

I commit to continue learning, improving weaknesses, and leveraging strengths to become an excellent Cloud Engineer/Solutions Architect in the future.
