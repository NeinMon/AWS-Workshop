# Sharing and Feedback on First Cloud Journey Program

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**  
The working environment at AWS FCJ is exceptionally professional and supportive. The hybrid work model provides flexibility while maintaining strong collaboration through regular online meetings. The AWS tools and infrastructure available for learning (Free Tier, Educate credits) remove financial barriers, allowing me to experiment freely with cloud services. The workspace is well-organized with clear documentation, comprehensive learning resources, and a vibrant community on Slack where interns share knowledge 24/7.

**Suggestion:** More virtual meetups or knowledge-sharing sessions would help build stronger connections among interns across different cohorts.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**  
My mentor provided exceptional guidance throughout the internship. They didn't just give answers but encouraged me to research, experiment, and troubleshoot independently—which significantly improved my problem-solving skills. Weekly 1-on-1 sessions helped me stay on track with my proposal project (Serverless Student Management System), and the mentor patiently reviewed my architecture designs, code quality, and AWS best practices.

The admin team was incredibly responsive—whether it was accessing AWS resources, resolving account issues, or providing workshop materials. Their quick turnaround time ensured I never lost momentum on my projects.

**What I appreciated most:** The mentor's approach of "guide, don't solve"—they would ask probing questions that led me to discover solutions myself, building my confidence and technical depth.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**  
As an IT major specializing in software engineering, this internship was perfectly aligned with my academic background while pushing me into new territory. The proposal project required me to:
- Apply software architecture principles (AWS Well-Architected Framework)
- Work with modern tech stacks (React, Java Spring Boot, serverless architecture)
- Implement CI/CD pipelines (GitLab, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy)
- Design scalable databases (DynamoDB with GSI)

This bridged the gap between theoretical knowledge from university and real-world cloud-native application development.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**  
This internship accelerated my learning curve dramatically. Key skills acquired:

**Technical Skills:**
- **AWS Services:** Mastered 14+ services (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Cognito, Amplify, EventBridge, SES, CloudWatch, Route53, CloudFront, WAF, S3, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy)
- **Serverless Architecture:** Event-driven design, microservices patterns, cost optimization
- **IaC:** AWS CDK/CloudFormation for infrastructure automation
- **REST API Development:** RESTful design patterns, polling mechanisms for chat
- **DevOps:** CI/CD pipeline design, automated testing, deployments
- **Security:** IAM policies, Cognito authentication, WAF rules, encryption

**Soft Skills:**
- Technical writing (blog translations, workshop documentation)
- Project management (8-week roadmap with clear milestones)
- Public speaking (demo presentations, knowledge sharing sessions)
- Time management (balancing multiple tasks: blogs, workshops, proposal)

The blog translation tasks helped me learn new AWS services in depth, while the workshop creation forced me to explain complex concepts clearly.

- **Recognition:** Regular acknowledgments for good work on Slack, which boosted morale
- **Work-Life Balance:** Flexible hours allowed me to manage university commitments alongside internship work

The team celebrates both big wins (completing proposal) and small victories (fixing a tricky Lambda issue), which kept motivation high.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐**  
**Benefits Provided:**
- Monthly internship allowance (competitive for student internships)
- AWS Educate credits (~$75-100) for hands-on learning
- Access to AWS training courses (AWS Skill Builder, whitepapers, certification prep materials)
- Flexible working hours (async-friendly for students)
- Recommendation letter upon successful completion
- Networking opportunities with AWS professionals

**Policies:**
- Clear expectations from Day 1 (worklog, blogs, workshop, proposal)

### Additional Questions

**1. What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**  
Building the **Serverless Student Management System** from scratch. Seeing all 14 AWS services work together seamlessly—from user authentication (Cognito) to chat system with polling mechanism to scalable API architecture—was incredibly rewarding. The moment I deployed the full CI/CD pipeline and watched GitLab automatically trigger builds and deployments was amazing. This project is now the centerpiece of my portfolio.

**2. What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
**Suggestions:**
- **Structured Onboarding:** A "Week 0" orientation covering AWS basics, common pitfalls, and tooling setup would help interns ramp up faster
- **Peer Mentorship:** Pair new interns with senior interns from previous cohorts for informal guidance
- **Advanced Challenges:** Optional "stretch goals" for interns who finish early (e.g., contributing to open-source AWS tools, participating in AWS GameDay)
- **Career Pathways:** Workshops on post-internship opportunities (full-time roles, startup cloud architect positions, etc.)

**3. If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why?**  
**Absolutely, yes—with context.**

**Recommend if your friend:**
- Wants to build serious cloud skills (not just surface-level AWS knowledge)
- Is self-motivated (this internship requires initiative and independent learning)
- Enjoys problem-solving and troubleshooting
- Seeks a portfolio project that impresses employers

**Not ideal if they:**
- Prefer highly structured, step-by-step tasks (FCJ expects autonomy)
- Only want to "complete checkboxes" (mentors push for depth, not just completion)
- Aren't comfortable with ambiguity (cloud projects require figuring things out)

**Bottom line:** This internship is what you make of it. If you invest effort, you'll gain skills that put you ahead of most IT graduates.

**2. Would you like to continue this program in the future?**  
Yes, I'd love to return as a **senior intern** or **peer mentor** for future cohorts. I have ideas for expanding the Student Management System (mobile app with AWS Amplify + Flutter, AI chat assistant with Amazon Bedrock). I'd also be interested in creating advanced workshops (e.g., "Building Production-Ready Serverless APIs" or "AWS Cost Optimization for Startups").

**3. Any other comments (free sharing):**

**What this internship taught me beyond tech:**
- **Bias for Action:** AWS culture emphasizes "try it and see" over endless planning—this mindset shift helped me overcome perfectionism
- **Thinking in Systems:** Designing serverless architectures taught me to think holistically (security + cost + performance + scalability)
- **Learning in Public:** Writing blogs and workshops forced me to articulate my understanding clearly

**A moment that mattered:**  
During Week 8, my DynamoDB queries were experiencing high latency and throttling issues. After 3 days of debugging (analyzing CloudWatch metrics, reviewing access patterns, testing GSI designs), I discovered the issue was improper partition key design causing hot partitions. The mentor didn't give me the answer—they asked questions that guided my troubleshooting process. When I finally optimized the schema and saw query times drop from 800ms to 50ms, the satisfaction was immense. This experience taught me resilience and systematic debugging—skills no classroom can teach.

**Final Thought:**  
FCJ isn't just an internship—it's a **launchpad**. The skills, mindset, and confidence I gained here will compound throughout my career. To future interns: embrace the challenges, ask lots of questions, and ship something you're proud of. The AWS cloud is your playground—build something amazing.
