Executive Summary Serverless Student Management Platform is a cloud-based student management platform designed for educational institutions and small businesses to enhance the ability to manage, analyze, and interact with student data. The platform supports up to 50-100 students initially, with the ability to flexibly scale up to 500–1000 students without major infrastructure changes, using AWS Serverless services such as Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway.\n2. Problem Statement Current Problem\nCurrent student management systems require manual data entry, which is difficult to manage when there are many classes. There is no centralized system for real-time data or analytics, and third-party platforms are often expensive and too complex.\nSolution\nThe platform uses Amazon API Gateway to receive REST requests, AWS Lambda to handle business logic, Amazon DynamoDB to store student data and scores. AWS Amplify with React/TypeScript provides the web interface, and Amazon Cognito ensures secure access. Similar to traditional LMS systems but at a lower cost, users can register new students and manage information, but the platform operates at a smaller scale and serves learning purposes.\nBenefits and ROI\nThe solution creates a basic foundation for IT students to develop serverless AWS skills, while providing effective management tools for teachers to support teaching and assessment. The platform reduces manual reporting for each class through a centralized system, simplifies management and maintenance, and improves data reliability. The estimated monthly cost is $7-20 USD according to the detailed budget estimate, totaling $40-60 USD for 3 months.\n3. Solution Architecture The system is designed according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework architecture with interconnected layers, ensuring data management, authentication, and monitoring capabilities. The serverless architecture helps optimize costs and ensure automatic scalability.\nAWS Core Services Used Services Key Features Key Benefits Amazon Route 53 Manage DNS and route traffic to CloudFront Set up custom domains, health checks, geo-routing, SSL integration to ensure secure and fast access.

As co-founder and Chief Brand Officer Rebecca Shostak shares: \u0026ldquo;Flodesk is a relationship-building software. I want everybody to harness the power of these one-on-one, intimate relationships that they can have with their followers.\u0026rdquo;\nRebecca\u0026rsquo;s design background is rooted in rock n\u0026rsquo; roll; she began her career designing merchandise for a company that needed, in her words, \u0026ldquo;a female touch\u0026rdquo; for the artists on their roster. It was her first exposure to designing for different types of brands—and creating beautiful designs that sold in a variety of styles. These are the skills that Rebecca brought with her on her first solo venture: a template shop designed for popular email platform MailChimp.\n\u0026ldquo;I had always wanted my own business. I\u0026rsquo;m from Silicon Valley, and I have entrepreneurship in my blood from my dad. I wanted to start my own company. I saw a niche for Photoshop templates for wedding photographers. And there was a huge demand for it,\u0026rdquo; Rebecca explains. When she ran into customers struggling to implement her designs into the MailChimp platform, a bigger idea was formed: a platform that allows people to create beautiful, branded emails easily. \u0026ldquo;All email marketing companies were eco-oriented, focused on workflows and integrations. They weren\u0026rsquo;t focusing on the brand and the design,\u0026rdquo; Rebecca says. \u0026ldquo;I was like, \u0026lsquo;I have to do this.\u0026rsquo; It was almost a religious calling.\u0026rdquo;\nMeanwhile, Flodesk\u0026rsquo;s co-founder CEO Martha Bitar was working in customer relationship management (CRM) for small business owners, in a similar market. \u0026ldquo;Martha was marinating in the same customer ecosystem that I was, just in different lanes,\u0026rdquo; Rebecca explains. Both Martha and Rebecca sensed a common problem in their world: \u0026ldquo;We see these people who are making millions of dollars with their services and their website looks amazing, their Instagram looks amazing, their photos look amazing, and their emails suck.\u0026rdquo;\nDesigning a New Narrative for Startups For Flodesk, it has always been about flipping the narrative. The company has strong roots in design—they were an early leader in dreaming big about how beautiful emails can be. The oxymoron formed by \u0026ldquo;beautiful\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;emails\u0026rdquo; built the foundation of what would become Flodesk, according to Rebecca: \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re taking softer products that, in the past, have been considered clunky, ugly, difficult to use, and just unappealing. For the small business market who\u0026rsquo;s extremely brand-focused, we\u0026rsquo;re flipping that on its head and making something that people never thought could be sexy, really sexy.\u0026rdquo;\nBut the company\u0026rsquo;s disruption doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop at design. When Martha and Rebecca came together to create their prototype around January 2018, they turned to the path relatively untrodden for startups. As Rebecca details: \u0026ldquo;we thought, what if we pitched this and did it without funding? What if we were able to validate it and get the software going without even taking venture capital money?\u0026rdquo; Leaning into this concept, by the summer of 2019, Flodesk had a prototype. When an influencer friend of Rebecca\u0026rsquo;s built and sent an email using Flodesk, adding a plug for it at the bottom, trial requests began flooding in. \u0026ldquo;Flodesk launched itself long before we had the actual launch,\u0026rdquo; says Rebecca.\nBuilding a Trusted Brand Through AWS Flodesk turned to Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a partner from the very beginning—the platform was built on Amazon Simple Email Service (SES). \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine Flodesk without AWS intertwined with it,\u0026rdquo; says Rebecca. \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re like the giant whose shoulders we\u0026rsquo;re standing on, in some sense, for our tech.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the early days, the founders faced infrastructure problems with a sudden influx of subscribers. As Rebecca details: \u0026ldquo;we started out with AWS and we built on them. We were so open at the beginning with our policies because we just wanted as many people in the door as possible, but we found that that let a lot of scammers in. We were so brand new, things were going so quickly—we weren\u0026rsquo;t able to put the proper barriers in place to get the scammers out at first.\u0026rdquo; Rebecca spent a lot of late nights on the phone with AWS to troubleshoot the issue. \u0026ldquo;Early on, there were a lot of really close calls,\u0026rdquo; she explains. \u0026ldquo;We had moments where we were getting our server shut down because of scamming. But since we\u0026rsquo;ve worked with AWS and partnered with them to advise us on how to build out a more and more robust trust and safety team, that\u0026rsquo;s led us to be where we are today. I just can\u0026rsquo;t imagine our story without AWS in it.\u0026rdquo;\nTony Silva, Flodesk\u0026rsquo;s startup portfolio lead at AWS, was there to answer those late-night calls from Rebecca. Tony now partners with Flodesk\u0026rsquo;s engineering team internationally to troubleshoot any issues that may pop up. As Tony explains, \u0026ldquo;with Flodesk, our relationship is outside even the tech perspective at this point. It\u0026rsquo;s about their entire infrastructure. It\u0026rsquo;s helping them lower their costs, making sure that they\u0026rsquo;re architected the right way, providing any sort of support, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a go-to-market or a personal relationship or a touchpoint.\u0026rdquo;\nFor Small Businesses, the Future is Bright Today, with 70,000 customers, over $20 million in annual recurring revenue, and 35 team members all over the world, Rebecca is still adjusting to enormous growth: \u0026ldquo;sometimes I still feel like I have no idea what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. But I think we always had that bootstrap mindset.\u0026rdquo;\nRebecca attributes a great deal of Flodesk\u0026rsquo;s success to the company\u0026rsquo;s founding principles. A focus on problem-solving for their customers continues to guide the company today. As Rebecca says: \u0026ldquo;we started with a founder idea. We had a product-market fit before we even touched a line of code. Start with the problem, not the solution. We were really focused on this segment of the market that\u0026rsquo;s been left behind by the legacy players. We wanted to create an experience where you could self-serve, that you weren\u0026rsquo;t reliant on going back and forth with our team. And one that was affordable too.\u0026rdquo;\nFor Rebecca, the future is \u0026ldquo;wildly exciting\u0026rdquo; for small businesses. \u0026ldquo;I really believe that small businesses, and the creative people that run them, are going to own the future. And that future really excites me,\u0026rdquo; she says. Her outlook for Flodesk is particularly bright: \u0026ldquo;I want Flodesk to be the household name that they associate with growing business. My vision is that you have a household, you have an Amazon Prime account, you have a small business, and you have a Flodesk account.\u0026rdquo;\nRebecca\u0026rsquo;s advice for startup founders? \u0026ldquo;Be scrappy. Sometimes the best ideas come from the scrappiest of places. Use your imagination and be creative.\u0026rdquo;\nBonnie McClure is an editor specializing in creating accessible, engaging content for all audiences and platforms.

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers access to high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral, Stabilityai, and Amazon through a single API. You can choose from a wide range of models to find the one that best fits your use case.\nInference as a building block When you\u0026rsquo;re building generative AI applications, you need to find the right balance between model capability and cost. Amazon Bedrock provides multiple options that allow you to optimize for your specific use case:\nOn-demand pricing: Pay for each token processed Provisioned throughput: Fixed hourly rate for predictable, high-volume workloads Batch processing: Lower-cost option for asynchronous jobs Flexible pricing models Amazon Bedrock offers flexible pricing options to match your workload patterns:\nOn-Demand Pricing Perfect for variable workloads with unpredictable traffic patterns. You pay only for what you use, with no upfront commitments.\nProvisioned Throughput Ideal for consistent, high-volume inference workloads. By committing to a fixed amount of throughput, you receive significant discounts compared to on-demand pricing.\nBatch API Designed for non-time-sensitive workloads, the Batch API offers the lowest cost per token, making it perfect for bulk processing tasks.\nStrategic model selection Choosing the right foundation model is crucial for cost optimization. Consider:\nModel capability vs. cost trade-off: Larger models are more capable but more expensive Use case requirements: Some use cases may work well with smaller, more efficient models Token consumption: Shorter prompts and outputs reduce costs Knowledge bases Amazon Bedrock\u0026rsquo;s knowledge bases feature enables you to incorporate your own data into your generative AI applications without fine-tuning models. This approach is more cost-effective than traditional fine-tuning and provides better control over your data.\nCustomization While foundation models are powerful out of the box, customization options include:\nPrompt engineering: Optimize your prompts to get better results with less computation Fine-tuning: For specialized use cases where you need domain-specific expertise Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): Combine FMs with your proprietary data for contextually relevant responses Distillation Model distillation is a technique where knowledge from a large model is transferred to a smaller, more efficient model. This can significantly reduce inference costs while maintaining acceptable performance for your specific use case.\nPrompt caching Prompt caching is an advanced feature that caches frequently used prompts, reducing processing time and costs for applications that reuse similar context or system prompts across multiple requests.\nAutomated reasoning Amazon Bedrock supports models optimized for complex reasoning tasks. These models can handle multi-step problem-solving more efficiently, reducing the number of API calls needed.\nConclusion Optimizing costs for generative AI applications requires a thoughtful approach that balances model capability with your budget constraints. By leveraging Amazon Bedrock\u0026rsquo;s flexible pricing models, strategic model selection, and advanced features like knowledge bases and prompt caching, you can build cost-effective generative AI solutions that scale with your business needs.\nAdam Richter is a Senior Optimization Solutions Architect at AWS, specializing in helping startups and enterprises optimize their costs for AI and machine learning workloads.

Working Environment ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nThe working environment at AWS FCJ is exceptionally professional and supportive. The hybrid work model provides flexibility while maintaining strong collaboration through regular online meetings. The AWS tools and infrastructure available for learning (Free Tier, Educate credits) remove financial barriers, allowing me to experiment freely with cloud services. The workspace is well-organized with clear documentation, comprehensive learning resources, and a vibrant community on Slack where interns share knowledge 24/7.\nSuggestion: More virtual meetups or knowledge-sharing sessions would help build stronger connections among interns across different cohorts.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nMy mentor provided exceptional guidance throughout the internship. They didn\u0026rsquo;t just give answers but encouraged me to research, experiment, and troubleshoot independently—which significantly improved my problem-solving skills. Weekly 1-on-1 sessions helped me stay on track with my proposal project (Serverless Student Management System), and the mentor patiently reviewed my architecture designs, code quality, and AWS best practices.\nThe admin team was incredibly responsive—whether it was accessing AWS resources, resolving account issues, or providing workshop materials. Their quick turnaround time ensured I never lost momentum on my projects.\nWhat I appreciated most: The mentor\u0026rsquo;s approach of \u0026ldquo;guide, don\u0026rsquo;t solve\u0026rdquo;—they would ask probing questions that led me to discover solutions myself, building my confidence and technical depth.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nAs an IT major specializing in software engineering, this internship was perfectly aligned with my academic background while pushing me into new territory. The proposal project required me to:\nApply software architecture principles (AWS Well-Architected Framework) Work with modern tech stacks (React, Java Spring Boot, serverless architecture) Implement CI/CD pipelines (GitLab, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy) Design scalable databases (DynamoDB with GSI) This bridged the gap between theoretical knowledge from university and real-world cloud-native application development.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nThis internship accelerated my learning curve dramatically. Key skills acquired:\nTechnical Skills:\nAWS Services: Mastered 14+ services (Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Cognito, Amplify, EventBridge, SES, CloudWatch, Route53, CloudFront, WAF, S3, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy) Serverless Architecture: Event-driven design, microservices patterns, cost optimization IaC: AWS CDK/CloudFormation for infrastructure automation REST API Development: RESTful design patterns, polling mechanisms for chat DevOps: CI/CD pipeline design, automated testing, deployments Security: IAM policies, Cognito authentication, WAF rules, encryption Soft Skills:\nTechnical writing (blog translations, workshop documentation) Project management (8-week roadmap with clear milestones) Public speaking (demo presentations, knowledge sharing sessions) Time management (balancing multiple tasks: blogs, workshops, proposal) The blog translation tasks helped me learn new AWS services in depth, while the workshop creation forced me to explain complex concepts clearly.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nAWS FCJ fosters a culture of continuous learning and collaboration. Key highlights:\nKnowledge Sharing: Weekly demo sessions where interns present their work, creating peer-learning opportunities Psychological Safety: I felt comfortable asking questions without judgment—everyone emphasizes that learning \u0026gt; perfection Diversity: Interns from various universities brought different perspectives Recognition: Regular acknowledgments for good work on Slack, which boosted morale Work-Life Balance: Flexible hours allowed me to manage university commitments alongside internship work The team celebrates both big wins (completing proposal) and small victories (fixing a tricky Lambda issue), which kept motivation high.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nBenefits Provided:\nMonthly internship allowance (competitive for student internships) AWS Educate credits (~$75-100) for hands-on learning Access to AWS training courses (AWS Skill Builder, whitepapers, certification prep materials) Flexible working hours (async-friendly for students) Recommendation letter upon successful completion Networking opportunities with AWS professionals Policies:\nClear expectations from Day 1 (worklog, blogs, workshop, proposal) Fair evaluation criteria (publicly available rubric) Regular feedback loops (weekly check-ins, mid-term review, final evaluation) What stood out: The investment in interns\u0026rsquo; growth beyond just task completion—mentors genuinely care about our long-term career success.\nAdditional Questions 1. What did you find most satisfying during your internship?\nBuilding the Serverless Student Management System from scratch. Seeing all 14 AWS services work together seamlessly—from user authentication (Cognito) to chat system with polling mechanism to scalable API architecture—was incredibly rewarding. The moment I deployed the full CI/CD pipeline and watched GitLab automatically trigger builds and deployments was amazing. This project is now the centerpiece of my portfolio.\n2. What do you think the company should improve for future interns?\nSuggestions:\nStructured Onboarding: A \u0026ldquo;Week 0\u0026rdquo; orientation covering AWS basics, common pitfalls, and tooling setup would help interns ramp up faster Peer Mentorship: Pair new interns with senior interns from previous cohorts for informal guidance Advanced Challenges: Optional \u0026ldquo;stretch goals\u0026rdquo; for interns who finish early (e.g., contributing to open-source AWS tools, participating in AWS GameDay) Career Pathways: Workshops on post-internship opportunities (full-time roles, startup cloud architect positions, etc.) 3. If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why?\nAbsolutely, yes—with context.\nRecommend if your friend:\nWants to build serious cloud skills (not just surface-level AWS knowledge) Is self-motivated (this internship requires initiative and independent learning) Enjoys problem-solving and troubleshooting Seeks a portfolio project that impresses employers Not ideal if they:\nPrefer highly structured, step-by-step tasks (FCJ expects autonomy) Only want to \u0026ldquo;complete checkboxes\u0026rdquo; (mentors push for depth, not just completion) Aren\u0026rsquo;t comfortable with ambiguity (cloud projects require figuring things out) Bottom line: This internship is what you make of it. If you invest effort, you\u0026rsquo;ll gain skills that put you ahead of most IT graduates.\nSuggestions \u0026amp; Expectations 1. Do you have suggestions to improve the internship experience?\nShort-term (next cohort):\nCreate a Starter Kit (sample IaC templates, common Lambda patterns, DynamoDB best practices) to reduce setup friction Host bi-weekly \u0026ldquo;Office Hours\u0026rdquo; where interns can drop in with questions Introduce Intern Spotlights (monthly blog posts featuring standout projects) Long-term (program evolution):\nFCJ Alumni Network: Platform for past interns to share job opportunities, collaborate on projects Certification Sponsorship: Cover AWS exam fees for interns who complete the program Open-Source Contributions: Partner with AWS Labs to let interns contribute to real AWS projects 2. Would you like to continue this program in the future?\nYes, I\u0026rsquo;d love to return as a senior intern or peer mentor for future cohorts. I have ideas for expanding the Student Management System (mobile app with AWS Amplify + Flutter, AI chat assistant with Amazon Bedrock). I\u0026rsquo;d also be interested in creating advanced workshops (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Building Production-Ready Serverless APIs\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;AWS Cost Optimization for Startups\u0026rdquo;).\n3. Any other comments (free sharing):\nWhat this internship taught me beyond tech:\nBias for Action: AWS culture emphasizes \u0026ldquo;try it and see\u0026rdquo; over endless planning—this mindset shift helped me overcome perfectionism Thinking in Systems: Designing serverless architectures taught me to think holistically (security + cost + performance + scalability) Learning in Public: Writing blogs and workshops forced me to articulate my understanding clearly A moment that mattered:\nDuring Week 8, my DynamoDB queries were experiencing high latency and throttling issues. After 3 days of debugging (analyzing CloudWatch metrics, reviewing access patterns, testing GSI designs), I discovered the issue was improper partition key design causing hot partitions.

Họ là những người tiên phong trong việc áp dụng các công nghệ mới, và khi nói đến trí tuệ nhân tạo tạo sinh (generative AI), họ đang ở vị trí dẫn đầu để chuyển đổi các ngành công nghiệp và định hình tương lai.\nĐó là lý do tại sao gần đây chúng tôi đã công bố a commitment of $230 million to accelerate the creation of generative AI applications by startups around the world, cũng như mùa thứ hai của AWS Generative AI Accelerator. Với những nỗ lực này, chúng tôi đang tăng cường cam kết hỗ trợ các nhà sáng lập startup đổi mới nhanh hơn và tái tạo trải nghiệm cùng ứng dụng của khách hàng thông qua generative AI.\nDựa trên thông báo này, hôm nay chúng tôi ra mắt AWS GenAI Lofts, một chuyến lưu diễn toàn cầu gồm các không gian hợp tác pop-up và những trải nghiệm nhập vai dành cho các startup và nhà phát triển, sẽ được tổ chức tại các trung tâm đổi mới và AI trên toàn thế giới. Sáng kiến này cũng thể hiện cam kết của chúng tôi trong việc giúp các nhà phát triển ở mọi cấp độ kỹ năng dễ dàng xây dựng và mở rộng các ứng dụng generative AI. Tương tự như AWS Startup Lofts ra mắt năm 2014, AWS GenAI Lofts cung cấp điểm đến “một cửa” cho việc giao lưu trực tiếp, nơi các startup và nhà phát triển có thể học cách sử dụng và triển khai công nghệ generative AI, cập nhật xu hướng mới nhất và kết nối với cộng đồng chuyên gia công nghệ cũng như kinh doanh rộng lớn hơn.\nVới AWS GenAI Lofts, các startup, nhà phát triển và người đam mê AI có thể trực tiếp trải nghiệm các sản phẩm và dịch vụ AI từ AWS Partners và AWS, bao gồm Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q. Các nhà phát triển sẽ có cơ hội hiểu sâu hơn về các kỹ thuật tiên tiến như xây dựng quy trình làm việc tự động hóa (agentic workflows), tinh chỉnh mô hình nền tảng (foundation models), và khám phá sâu hơn các trường hợp sử dụng cùng bản demo về generative AI. Khách tham quan có thể tham gia các buổi chia sẻ độc quyền được dẫn dắt bởi các chuyên gia trong ngành, kết nối với các nhà đầu tư và lãnh đạo trong lĩnh vực generative AI, đồng thời được các chuyên gia giải đáp thắc mắc trực tiếp tại chỗ.\nCác địa điểm pop-up sẽ mở cửa trong thời gian lên đến 12 tuần tại các trung tâm đổi mới toàn cầu, bao gồm:\nAWS GenAI Loft | Bengaluru: July 29, 2024\nAWS GenAI Loft | San Francisco: August 12, 2024\nAWS GenAI Loft | São Paulo: September 2, 2024\nAWS GenAI Loft | London: September 30, 2024\nAWS GenAI Loft | Paris: October 8, 2024\nKhách tham quan sẽ được trải nghiệm các hoạt động nhập vai giới thiệu các dự án generative AI tiên tiến, workshop, tọa đàm thân mật (fireside chats), và các chương trình thực hành trực tiếp do các chuyên gia AI và đối tác AWS dẫn dắt như Anthropic, Cerebral Valley, and Weights \u0026amp; Biases, cùng nhiều tổ chức khác.

Trong các bài viết trước, chúng tôi đã khám phá các nguyên tắc Cloud Financial Management principles on generative AI adoption và các chiến lược phát triển mô hình tùy chỉnh bằng Amazon EC2 and Amazon SageMaker AI. Hôm nay, chúng tôi sẽ hướng dẫn bạn các kỹ thuật tối ưu hóa chi phí cho Amazon Bedrock — từ việc đưa ra quyết định sáng suốt về pricing model, lựa chọn mô hình, tối ưu hóa knowledge base, prompt caching, cho đến Automated Reasoning. Dù bạn mới bắt đầu hay đang tìm cách tối ưu hóa việc triển khai Amazon Bedrock hiện có, những kỹ thuật này sẽ giúp bạn cân bằng giữa năng lực và chi phí trong khi vẫn tận dụng sự tiện lợi của các mô hình AI được quản lý.\nAmazon Bedrock là gì? Amazon Bedrock là một dịch vụ được quản lý hoàn toàn, cung cấp quyền truy cập vào các foundation models (FMs) hàng đầu từ nhiều công ty AI thông qua một API thống nhất. Điều này giúp các nhà phát triển xây dựng và mở rộng các ứng dụng generative AI mà không cần quản lý hạ tầng phức tạp. Các lợi ích chính bao gồm: khả năng chuyển đổi mô hình liền mạch, bảo mật cấp doanh nghiệp, khả năng customize and fine-tune models, và tích hợp trực tiếp với các dịch vụ AWS khác. Amazon Bedrock mang đến nhiều công cụ mạnh mẽ để giúp bạn cân bằng giữa chi phí và hiệu suất.\nInference, khối xây dựng mới trong các ứng dụng hiện đại Tại AWS re:Invent 2024 – CEO Keynote with Matt Garman), Giám đốc điều hành Matt Garman đã giới thiệu một sự thay đổi về cách chúng ta nhìn nhận kiến trúc ứng dụng: đặt inference như một khối xây dựng cơ bản của các ứng dụng hiện đại, bên cạnh compute, storage và database (listen to Matt’s keynote presentation, AWS re:Invent 2024 – CEO Keynote with Matt Garman). Khi bạn ngày càng tích hợp khả năng generative AI vào quy trình vận hành, việc quản lý và tối ưu hóa chi phí suy luận sẽ trở nên quan trọng như quản lý chi phí đám mây truyền thống. Để hỗ trợ xu hướng này, AWS đã giới thiệu inference-level Cost Allocation Tags, cung cấp khả năng hiển thị chi tiết về chi phí suy luận. trực quan hóa và phân tích chi phí ở cấp độ inference, đồng thời đưa ra quyết định dựa trên dữ liệu để chọn mô hình phù hợp.\nMô hình định giá linh hoạt cho mọi trường hợp sử dụng Mô hình pricing model linh hoạt của Amazon Bedrock bao gồm ba tùy chọn chính: 1) On-Demand cho sự linh hoạt trả tiền theo mức sử dụng, 2) Provisioned Throughput mang lại mức tiết kiệm 40–60% thông qua cam kết trong một hoặc sáu tháng, và 3) batch processing có thể cung cấp mức giá thấp hơn tới 50% so với on-demand. Việc chọn lựa tùy chọn giá tối ưu là rất quan trọng đối với thành công của bạn vì nó ảnh hưởng trực tiếp đến kết quả tài chính và hiệu quả vận hành. Bạn có thể tối ưu hóa chi tiêu trong khi vẫn duy trì chất lượng dịch vụ bằng cách chọn tùy chọn phù hợp nhất: On-Demand cho khối lượng công việc biến động, Provisioned Throughput cho các mô hình sử dụng ổn định, hoặc Batch processing cho các hoạt động không yêu cầu thời gian xử lý nhanh. Sự linh hoạt này hỗ trợ nhiều giai đoạn triển khai AI khác nhau, cho phép phân bổ tài nguyên hợp lý, ngăn ngừa tình trạng cung cấp vượt mức và đảm bảo khả năng dự đoán ngân sách tốt hơn. Việc đưa ra quyết định về giá một cách có thông tin là điều cần thiết, vì lựa chọn sai có thể dẫn đến chi phí không cần thiết, ảnh hưởng đến cả hiệu quả hoạt động và kết quả tài chính cuối cùng.\nLựa chọn mô hình chiến lược Hình 1. Amazon Bedrock cung cấp danh mục mô hình được quản lý toàn diện rộng nhất từ các công ty AI hàng đầu.\nViệc lựa chọn mô hình trong Amazon Bedrock là một quyết định mang tính chiến lược có thể ảnh hưởng đến chi phí, hiệu quả và kết quả hiệu suất. Amazon Bedrock cung cấp quyền truy cập vào các foundation models đa dạng từ các nhà lãnh đạo trong ngành như Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI và Amazon. Ngoài các mô hình có sẵn từ những nhà cung cấp đó, bạn có thể tận dụng hơn 100 mô hình khác trong Amazon Bedrock Marketplace. Thay vì cam kết với một mô hình hoặc một nhà cung cấp duy nhất, bạn có thể tận dụng tính linh hoạt của Amazon Bedrock để chuyển đổi liền mạch giữa các mô hình với những thay đổi mã tối thiểu. Khi các mô hình mới hơn, hiệu quả hơn được phát hành, bạn có thể dễ dàng chuyển đổi để tiết kiệm chi phí và tăng hiệu suất. Khả năng xử lý hàng loạt (batch processing) của nền tảng càng tăng cường lợi thế này bằng cách cho phép đánh giá liên tục các mô hình mới khi chúng có sẵn, đảm bảo các giải pháp luôn được tối ưu theo thời gian và duy trì lợi thế cạnh tranh trong bối cảnh AI phát triển nhanh chóng. Cách tiếp cận chiến lược này đối với sự đa dạng và đánh giá mô hình giúp bạn tối đa hóa khoản đầu tư AI trong khi vẫn duy trì sự linh hoạt trong vận hành.\nMột yếu tố khác cần xem xét khi lựa chọn mô hình là thời gian phản hồi. Một số mô hình của Amazon Bedrock hỗ trợ cấu hình được tối ưu hóa độ trễ, xem Optimize model inference for latency, giúp cung cấp thời gian phản hồi nhanh hơn so với hiệu suất tiêu chuẩn. Các mô hình này cải thiện hiệu quả và khiến các ứng dụng AI sinh của bạn phản hồi nhanh hơn. Hiện tại, bạn có thể sử dụng các cấu hình được tối ưu hóa độ trễ cho Amazon Nova Pro, Claude 3.5 Haiku của Anthropic và Llama 3.1 405B và 70B của Meta, chạy nhanh hơn trên AWS so với bất kỳ nơi nào khác.\nTận dụng Knowledge Bases Amazon Bedrock hỗ trợ việc bao gồm các Knowledge Base cho phép bạn tạo ra các ứng dụng AI sinh sinh tùy chỉnh, có độ chính xác cao, độ trễ thấp và an toàn bằng cách kết hợp thông tin ngữ cảnh từ các nguồn dữ liệu của riêng bạn. Knowledge Base, còn được gọi là RAG (retrieval augmented generation), có thể mang lại các phản hồi chính xác, phù hợp và cập nhật hơn. Việc sử dụng Knowledge Base giúp bạn nhận được các câu trả lời chất lượng cao hơn, từ đó tiết kiệm chi phí nhờ giảm số lượng prompt và phản hồi cần thiết để có được câu trả lời phù hợp. Yếu tố chính để tối ưu hóa Knowledge Base là quản lý dữ liệu và tần suất lập chỉ mục. Phí lập chỉ mục (indexing fees) là yếu tố chi phí chính và được tính theo mỗi đối tượng hoặc giờ OpenSearch Compute Unit (OCU), tùy thuộc vào cơ sở dữ liệu vector được sử dụng.\nBa điều bạn có thể làm để giảm thiểu các chi phí này là:\nChỉ bao gồm dữ liệu liên quan trong (các) nguồn dữ liệu của bạn để tránh lập chỉ mục những dữ liệu không đóng góp vào giải pháp của bạn.\nTránh cập nhật hoặc chỉnh sửa các tệp đã được lập chỉ mục. Nếu một tệp bị chỉnh sửa, tệp đó sẽ được lập chỉ mục lại, điều này sẽ phát sinh thêm chi phí.\nXóa dữ liệu không còn cần thiết để đơn giản hóa chỉ mục của bạn. Việc này sẽ giảm tổng chi phí lập chỉ mục và tăng tốc độ xử lý các yêu cầu đối với dữ liệu đã lập chỉ mục.\nBằng cách tuân theo các thực tiễn này, bạn có thể đạt được giảm chi phí và tốc độ lập chỉ mục nhanh hơn cho các triển khai Knowledge Base của mình.\nHình 2. Amazon Bedrock có hỗ trợ gốc cho Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\nTùy chỉnh để nâng cao hiệu suất Những tiến bộ gần đây trong khả năng fine-tuning đã giúp việc tối ưu hóa hiệu suất mô hình trở nên dễ dàng hơn bao giờ hết. Giờ đây, bạn có thể customize and fine-tune models, bằng cách sử dụng dữ liệu của riêng mình mà không cần phải viết mã. Điều này giảm nhu cầu huấn luyện lại mô hình liên tục và mang lại một giải pháp vận hành hiệu quả hơn, ít tốn kém hơn nhờ vào chất lượng đầu ra cao hơn.\nDistillation để có hiệu suất tiết kiệm chi phí hơn Tính năng Model Distillation của Amazon Bedrock đại diện cho một cơ hội để cân bằng giữa hiệu suất và hiệu quả. Thông qua một quá trình chuyển giao tri thức tinh vi từ các mô hình “giáo viên” lớn sang các mô hình “học sinh” nhỏ hơn, công nghệ này cho phép bạn đạt được sự tối ưu hóa mà không ảnh hưởng đáng kể đến độ chính xác. Quy trình này tạo ra các mô hình đã được chưng cất (distilled models) có thể hoạt động nhanh hơn tới 500% và tiết kiệm chi phí lên đến 75% so với mô hình ban đầu, với mức mất độ chính xác dưới 2% cho các trường hợp sử dụng như RAG. Tính năng này giải quyết sự đánh đổi truyền thống giữa khả năng của mô hình và hiệu quả vận hành, giúp các ứng dụng AI tiên tiến trở nên dễ tiếp cận và khả thi về mặt kinh tế hơn cho mọi quy mô ngân sách.\nHình 3. So sánh hiệu suất của các mô hình tiên tiến với các mô hình tiết kiệm chi phí cho trường hợp sử dụng của bạn bằng phương pháp chưng cất mô hình\nPrompt Caching để giảm chi phí và độ trễ Khả năng prompt caching của Amazon Bedrock mang lại lợi ích vượt trội về chi phí và hiệu năng. Bằng cách lưu vào bộ nhớ đệm (cache) các prompt được sử dụng thường xuyên trên nhiều lần gọi API, tính năng này loại bỏ nhu cầu xử lý lại các yêu cầu giống hệt nhau. Kết quả là giảm tới 90% chi phí và giảm 85% độ trễ cho các mô hình được hỗ trợ. Prompt caching hoạt động bằng cách tái sử dụng các tiền tố (prefix) của prompt đã được lưu trong bộ nhớ đệm, bỏ qua việc phải xử lý lại các tiền tố trùng khớp, từ đó giảm đáng kể tài nguyên tính toán cần thiết để tạo đầu ra mà vẫn duy trì chất lượng phản hồi. Tối ưu hóa này giúp việc triển khai AI ở quy mô doanh nghiệp trở nên kinh tế hơn và phản hồi nhanh hơn.\nAutomated Reasoning để Cải Thiện Độ Chính Xác Thông qua việc tích hợp Automated Reasoning, Amazon Bedrock mang đến cơ hội để nâng cao độ chính xác của AI tạo sinh (generative AI) và tối ưu hóa chi phí. Automated Reasoning có sẵn thông qua Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, và sử dụng các phương pháp toán học để đảm bảo tính chính xác trong những lĩnh vực quan trọng như nhân sự, tài chính và tuân thủ (compliance). Quy trình chứng minh toán học này không chỉ tăng độ tin cậy của phản hồi, mà còn cải thiện hiệu quả vận hành bằng cách giảm số lượng prompt mà bạn cần nhập để có được một câu trả lời chính xác. Hơn nữa, bằng cách cung cấp bằng chứng về độ chính xác và giải thích logic cho từng phản hồi, hệ thống giúp bạn đẩy nhanh việc ứng dụng AI trong các trường hợp yêu cầu độ chính xác cao, đồng thời tiết kiệm nguồn lực vốn thường được dùng cho xác minh thủ công và sửa lỗi. Khi kết hợp giữa độ chính xác cao hơn, chi phí tương tác thấp hơn, và khả năng xác minh tự động, mức tiết kiệm chi phí tổng thể có thể trở nên đáng kể.\nKết Luận Bằng cách triển khai các chiến lược tối ưu hóa được đề cập ở trên, bạn có thể giảm đáng kể chi phí trong khi vẫn duy trì hoặc cải thiện hiệu suất. Điều quan trọng là liên tục đánh giá và điều chỉnh cách tiếp cận của bạn khi các tính năng và khả năng mới được phát hành. Với tính linh hoạt và bộ tính năng toàn diện, Amazon Bedrock là nền tảng lý tưởng để tối ưu hóa việc triển khai generative AI của bạn.\nChúng tôi đã đề cập đến nhiều phương pháp khác nhau để tối ưu hóa chi phí phát triển ứng dụng generative AI trên Amazon Bedrock. Trong bài viết tiếp theo, chúng tôi sẽ khám phá các chiến lược tối ưu chi phí cho Amazon Q, bao gồm lựa chọn cấp giá (pricing tier selection), quản lý người dùng (user management), và lập chỉ mục nội dung (content indexing). Hãy cùng theo dõi để tìm hiểu cách tận dụng tối đa trợ lý được hỗ trợ bởi AI của AWS, đồng thời duy trì hiệu quả chi phí.\nAdam Richter Adam Richter là Kiến trúc sư Giải pháp Tối ưu hóa Cấp cao (Senior Optimization Solutions Architect) tại AWS OPTICS, nơi ông tập trung vào tối ưu hóa chi phí AI và các phương pháp hay nhất về FinOps.
